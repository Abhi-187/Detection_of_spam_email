Spam Mail Detection
This project aims to develop a spam mail detection system using machine learning techniques. The system will analyze incoming emails and classify them as either spam or legitimate based on their content and other relevant features.

Introduction
Spam emails are unsolicited messages sent in bulk, often with malicious intent. They can be a significant nuisance, leading to wasted time, compromised security, and decreased productivity. This project focuses on building a spam mail detection system that can automatically identify and filter out spam emails.

The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze various email features, such as subject line, sender information, and email content, to make predictions about whether an email is spam or legitimate. By training a model on labeled data, the system can learn patterns and characteristics associated with spam emails and make accurate predictions on unseen data.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/spam-mail-detection.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd spam-mail-detection
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use the spam mail detection system:

Prepare the email data (see Data section for more details).

Train the model using the provided training script (see Model Training section).

Evaluate the trained model on a test dataset (see Evaluation section).

Use the trained model to classify new incoming emails.

Data
The success of the spam mail detection system heavily relies on the quality and diversity of the training data. It is important to have a well-labeled dataset that contains a sufficient number of spam and legitimate emails.

The dataset should be organized in the following format:

markdown
Copy code
dataset/
├── spam/
│   ├── spam_email1.txt
│   ├── spam_email2.txt
│   └── ...
└── legitimate/
    ├── legit_email1.txt
    ├── legit_email2.txt
    └── ...
You can create separate folders for spam and legitimate emails, and each email should be stored as a separate text file.

Model Training
To train the spam mail detection model:

Prepare the email dataset (see Data section).

Run the training script:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --data_path /path/to/dataset
The script will preprocess the data, extract relevant features, train the model, and save the trained model to a file.

Adjust the hyperparameters and experiment with different models as needed.

Evaluation
To evaluate the trained model on a test dataset:

Prepare a separate test dataset following the same format as the training dataset.

Run the evaluation script:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/trained_model --data_path /path/to/test_dataset
The script will load the trained model, preprocess the test data, make predictions, and calculate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

Analyze the evaluation results and fine-tune the model as necessary.
