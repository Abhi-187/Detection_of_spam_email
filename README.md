## Introduction

Spam emails are unsolicited messages sent in bulk, often with malicious intent. They can be a significant nuisance, leading to wasted time, compromised security, and decreased productivity. This project focuses on building a spam mail detection system that can automatically identify and filter out spam emails.

The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze various email features, such as subject line, sender information, and email content, to make predictions about whether an email is spam or legitimate. By training a model on labeled data, the system can learn patterns and characteristics associated with spam emails and make accurate predictions on unseen data.
